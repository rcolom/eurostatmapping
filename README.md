#EurostatMapping

This is a repo with datasets and information for testing mapping of Eurostat data.
You can find the set of tutorials on my website http://www.geekymango.com
Shapefiles used can be found in Eurostat website
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/gisco_Geographical_information_maps/popups/references/administrative_units_statistical_units_1
Data used can be also found in their database

##Files

Some of the data (from Eurostat and external sources) doesn’t have a GEO code, thus I created 
a file including the connection link. 

NUTeqcount -> Equivalence between NUT1 GEO Code and Country name.

Sample code can be found in the files below + its results in PNG format.

mapExample.R -> R script to create a map of Europe with sample data.
mapExample.png -> Result of the script above.
